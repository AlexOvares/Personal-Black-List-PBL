How this helps you ? The PBL also gives you the possibility to see on your LFG and Player Tooltips a little warning that they are on your list and not just that also the PBL has an internal functionality that if you get in a group with a player, that's part of your list will show you a Warning mentioning that player and giving you the possibility to leave the group before your activity starts.
 
When this Add-on is useful? Literally on any part of the game that includes matching with people that you don't know as Mythics +, Raids, Guilds , World & PvP.
 
How to use it ? You can toggle the PBL UI by clicking your new minimap icon or by writing on your chat /pbl , as soon you see your new interface,you just need to insert the name of the person in the current format:  Name-Realm, pick a category ,a reason and a class for your ban and that's it that person now will be included on your Personal Blacklist.
 
How to copy a weird name into the PBL ? Right Click the player portrait or chat name and select the option Give PBL Ban or simple toggle your chat and shift+click on the name of the person on the chat and you will get his name and realm on it , simply copy and paste that into your PBL.
